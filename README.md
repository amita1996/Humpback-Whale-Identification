# Humpback-Whale-Identification

As a part of the Data Science workshop at the Open University of Israel we tackled the problem of [Humpback Whale Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/humpback-whale-identification/overview) dataset on Kaggle.

In our solution we used EfficientNetV2_S, ArcFace Loss and YoloV7 in order to achieve 88.5% on the test data.

The project is not yet finished and will be updated in the following days.
